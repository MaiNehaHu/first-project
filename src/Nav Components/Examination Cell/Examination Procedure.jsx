        <h4 className="heads">Attendance Requirements and Detention Policy</h4>
        <p className="lines">
          It is desirable for a candidate to put on 100% attendance in each
          course. In every course (theory/laboratory), student has to maintain a
          minimum of 75% attendance including the days of attendance in sports,
          games, NCC and NSS activities to be eligible for appearing in Semester
          End Examination of the course.
          <br />
          For cases of medical issues, deficiency of attendance in each course
          to the extent of 10% may be condoned by the College Academic Committee
          (CAC) on the recommendation of Head of the department if their
          attendance is between 75% to 65% in every course, subjected to
          submission of medical certificates, medical case file and other
          needful documents to the concerned departments.
          <br />
          The basis for the calculation of the attendance shall be the period
          prescribed by the institute by its calendar of events. For late
          admission, attendance is reckoned from the date of admission to the
          program.
          <br />
          However, in case of a student having less than 65% attendance in any
          course, s/he shall be detained in the course and in no case such
          process will be relaxed. A candidate shall put in a minimum required
          attendance at least three (3) theory courses for getting promoted to
          next higher class / semester. Otherwise, s/he shall be declared
          detained and has to repeat semester. Students whose shortage of
          attendance is not condoned in any subject are not eligible to write
          their semester end examination of that courses and their registration
          shall stand cancelled.
          <br />
          A student not be promoted to the next semester may seek readmission
          into that semester when offered next. If any candidate fulfills the
          attendance requirement in the present semester, he shall not be
          eligible for readmission into the same class. Any student against whom
          any disciplinary action by the institute is pending shall not be
          permitted to attend any SEE in that semester.
