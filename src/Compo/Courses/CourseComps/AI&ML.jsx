            Artificial Intelligence[AI] and Machine Learning[ML] are correlated
            each other. AI is a bigger concept to create intelligent machine
            that can simulate human thinking capability where as ML is a subset
            of AI that allow a machines to learn from Data. Artificial
            Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning(ML) has become an integral
            part of technology in our daily lives, getting news updates ,driving
            to office, searching for a restaurant, getting medical alerts and
            recommendations on social media are all using AI and ML. With
            increase in usage, there is a significant requirement of researchers
            in the areas ofAi & ML.

            This specialization is designed to enable
            students to build intelligent machines, software, or applications
            with a cutting-edge combination of machine learning, analytics and
            visualization technologies. The main goal of artificial intelligence
            and machine learning is to program computers to use example data or
            experience to solve a given problem.

            This program will provide students an opportunity to learn
            both foundational and experimental components of Artificial
            Intelligence and Machine Learning.
